PEP 8, Style Guide for Python Code, requires a coder to write lines no longer than 79 characters. Given some code line, find out if it satisfies PEP 8 requirements.

Example

For line = "b = a + 4", the output should be
pepEight2(line) = true.

Input/Output

[execution time limit] 4 seconds (py3)

[input] string line

Guaranteed constraints:
5 ≤ line.length ≤ 100.

[output] boolean

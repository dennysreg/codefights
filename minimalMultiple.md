Find the smallest multiple of the given number that's not less than a specified lower bound.

Example

For divisor = 5 and lowerBound = 12, the output should be
minimalMultiple(divisor, lowerBound) = 15.

Input/Output

[execution time limit] 4 seconds (py3)

[input] integer divisor

Guaranteed constraints:
1 ≤ divisor ≤ 15.

[input] integer lowerBound

Guaranteed constraints:
1 ≤ lowerBound ≤ 600.

[output] integer

Smallest positive integer which is divisible by divisor and is not less than lowerBound.

Given unsorted array of integers, check if it contains at least two equal numbers.

Example

For sequence = [1, 3, 2, 1], the output should be
findEqual(sequence) = true;
For sequence = [1, 3, 2], the output should be
findEqual(sequence) = false.

[input] array.integer sequence

Unsorted array of integers.

Guaranteed constraints:
2 ≤ sequence.length ≤ 1000,
-109 ≤ sequence[i] ≤ 109.

[output] boolean

true if sequence contains at least two equal numbers, false otherwise.

Given the angle measure, find its type. Here's how different angles are called:

angles less than 90° are called "acute" angles;
an angle equal to 90° is called a "right" angle;
angles between 90° and 180° are called "obtuse" angles;
an angle equal to 180° is called a "straight" angle.
Example

For measure = 125, the output should be
angleType(measure) = "obtuse";
For measure = 72, the output should be
angleType(measure) = "acute".
Input/Output

[execution time limit] 4 seconds (py3)

[input] integer measure

The angle measure (in degrees), an integer not larger than 180.

Guaranteed constraints:
1 ≤ measure ≤ 180.

[output] string

The type of the angle (i.e. "acute", "right", "obtuse" or "straight").

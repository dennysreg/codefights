Calculate the LCPD (least common prime divisor) of two numbers.

Example

For a = 12 and b = 13, the output should be
leastCommonPrimeDivisor(a, b) = -1;
For a = 12 and b = 18, the output should be
leastCommonPrimeDivisor(a, b) = 2.

[input] integer a

A positive integer.

Guaranteed constraints:
2 ≤ a ≤ 150.

[input] integer b

A positive integer.

Guaranteed constraints:
2 ≤ b ≤ 150.

[output] integer

LCPD of a and b, -1 if it doesn't exist.
